We need the most currect survey and all the candidates as well as the faculty user info os they can conduct surveys or be locked out of them. 

  What is confusing me here is one of many things. 

    Surveys
    ___

    • Do evals. choose students from the list or are they assigned by an admin?
    • How many surveys are associated with a candidate.?
    • Can an eval. chage years?

    Scheduling
    ___
    
    • How many interviews can a candidate have.

    Ranking
    ___
    
    • What fundamental system do you want here? We need to clearly deine the rules. I would like a system that is fair and very well defined. I would also like to keep the data for furthur analysis for improvements upon the ranking system. 

    All these questions need ot be addressed before the db schema can be solidified or we will have extreme interface 
    code maintenance problems. 

    What should the schema be?
      • We will definately need modifications ot the candidate model. 

      candidate model could take an array called:
        surveys: [
          {
            "uuid" : "",
            "date" : "",
            "evaluator" : "UUID"
            "questions" : [],
            "total"
          }
        ]

        API METHODS
          CANDIDATE: addSurvey(candidate, survey)



HOW THE CRAP ARE WE GOING TO DO THE SCHEDULING? 

GET ALL THE EVALUATORS

SHOULD ADMIN BE THE ONE TO SET INTERVIEW DAYS? IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER IF THEY DID?

HOW IS THIS GOING TO EFFECT THE SCHEMA? DO WE NEED A DATES TABLE? WHAT WOULD MAKE MOST SENSE IN THE CURRENT DB?

I THINK AN INTERVIEWS TABLE WOULD BE THE WAY TO GO 

interviews: [
          {
            "uuid" : "",
            "date" : "",
            "organization" : {}
            "evaluator" : {}
          }
        ]
