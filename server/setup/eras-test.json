For this I went through lengthy treatment course in Canada, France, and Kuwait, including failed ORIF of both shoulders,  arthroscopic revision of both shoulders, and kyphoplasty for the L1 fracture.

One way I did this was by taking care of my grandfather, who was suffering from cancer. During my 1st year of medical school his health declined. He was hospitalized many times and put on hospice. I spent a lot of time at home focused on my grandfather’s health rather than school. He later passed away in the comfort of our home. His death took a heavy toll on me and as a result my studies suffered and I repeated my 1st year.",

In college and the Army I had support systems that I relied upon. Entering med school I was immediately overwhelmed but I was resilient as I have been my entire life. I may have taken longer to reach this point but I truly know the material and represent a well-rounded applicant. Residency will need determination, willingness to learn and adjust, and resiliency, which I have.",

        "Explanation of why Medical Education or Training Interrupted": "I had the opportunity to participate in a FlexMD program at my institution. This was a 12 month extension between years 3 and 4 of medical school where I worked on various research projects in the field of orthopaedics. Unfortunately, my parents' home had a house fire on 12/26/2017 in which my brother passed away. I did take a few weeks away from research to help my family. I was able to regroup and complete my projects, but submission has been delayed.",

While I dealt with those issues, I took some time from school. \n\nAfter not matching in 2017, I opted to pursue research opportunities in Orthopedics. Since research would be on a  volunteer basis, I postponed graduation in the hopes of being able to secure student loans to help cover my cost of living while I did research. As a result, my graduation date was formally recorded in Nov 2017.",

In addition to other surgery apps, this gap year allowed me to develop an artificial intelligence based mobile app for orthopaedic surgeons to identify any total joint prosthesis based only on an x-ray. My fiance was also accepted for a 1 year ENT research fellowship, thus taking a gap year has allowed us to enter the couples match.",

        "Explanation of why Medical Education or Training Interrupted": "A few weeks after starting medical school (and coincidentally my daughter also starting kindergarten), my wife's father fell ill. She is from a small town in Alabama, and her father had no other family so she went back home to take care of and spend time with him for about 3 months as he was dying. This left me here trying to learn to be a medical student and a single father of a new kindergarten student. I failed 3 out of 4 courses. Upon appeal, I was given a second chance and have done well since.",

To be proactive, I sought help from educational services, advisers, and deans. I decided to adjust my schedule such that I could focus on the remaining courses and, most importantly, learn how to be an efficient medical student. The following term, I devoted my time to studying anatomy, continued on to take an anatomy dissection elective course and became a gross anatomy lab assistant.",

I was able to learn from pioneers in the field of orthopaedic surgery while performing meaningful research in pathoanatomy, surgical techniques, and clinical outcomes. I have been passionate about orthopaedics since I began medical school, and this was a phenomenal opportunity to gain invaluable experience in the field for an entire year.",
