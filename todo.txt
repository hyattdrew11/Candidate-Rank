Below is a list of things we noticed yesterday on the website that need to be corrected:

 

Color scheme does not match the Candidate Rank logo.
- If you hit the “Back” button in the welcome wizard, it removes your data. *

- When you select first interview date, it inputs two dates in the interview date slot. *

- There needs to be a better way to tie the interview dates with the evaluator. This makes it very confusing for the user. *

- When you hit “Save Progress”, it doesn’t actually save your progress. Also, it should say “This name already exists” when you try to save a file with the same name.

- After each step under setup, there should be a message that says “Would you like to move to the next step?” once the field is populated.

- CSV file upload works but it doesn’t say “Import Complete” and the list that was imported doesn’t move to the other screens (i.e. pre-interview, schedule, etc.). There are no candidates listed anywhere 	else.  *

- There is not an area to upload PDFs.

When you select True or False for pre-interview doesn’t stay with evaluator. *

There should be a “Save Progress” button on every page.
Survey doesn’t say “Survey Complete” once you go through all the steps.
Once you complete the survey, there is not a “Done” button.
