I am thankful for all of the faculty members that took time out to recognize my dedication to medicine and its positive impact on patient care.","2015 Outstanding Alumni: Bowie State University: Every year, I return to my alma mater to talk to current students about my path to becoming a physician and I detail other paths in healthcare to give them options for their future. I was awarded this award for those efforts.
